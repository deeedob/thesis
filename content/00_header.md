abstract: |
  The Qt framework is well-established in the domain of cross-platform
  application development, yet its application within audio plugin development
  has remained largely unexplored. This thesis explores the integration of Qt
  in audio plugin development, examining the synergy between Qt's robust GUI
  capabilities and the emerging CLAP (Clever Audio Plugin) standard. CLAP, with
  its emphasis on simplicity, clarity, and robustness, offers a streamlined and
  intuitive API that aligns with Qt's design principles.

  By integrating gRPC, an open-source and high performance Remote Procedure
  Call framework, the research explores new possibilities for remote
  interactions between audio plugins and host applications. This integration
  points to a flexible, scalable approach, suitable for modern software
  design.

  This thesis introduces a novel approach to audio plugin development that
  leverages the combined strengths of Qt, CLAP, and gRPC. The developed libraries
  offer a uniform and adaptable user experience across diverse operating systems
  and streamline the process of plugin creation. This research addresses
  long-standing challenges in integrating Qt within audio plugin environments,
  effectively overcoming barriers that have hindered this integration in the
  past. This work stands as a testament to the untapped potential of Qt in the
  domain of audio plugins, paving the way for advancements in audio plugin
  creation that enhance both user engagement and developer workflow.
