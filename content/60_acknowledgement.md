# Chapter 6: Acknowledgements

At this point, I want to thank everyone involved within this project.
The timespan of this research predated the begin of this thesis. Initially
thought of a simple "Proof of Concept" implementation, over time grew
in complexity and in the end even suprised me. I was on to something and I
could feel the growing potential of this work. I wanted to get this right.

> Every small thing holds the potential to grow beyond expectations.

With this, I want to greatly thank *The Qt Company*, without their trust in my
idea and the flexibillity they provided, the countless hours i've spent during
my work-time into investing these problems and researching topics. While always
staying supportive in all regards, this project would *never happened in this
way!*

Additionally I also want to thank the *Cologne University of Applied Sciences*,
and especially *Prof. Dr. Arnulph Fuhrmann*, for providing the boundary conditions
for me to unfold my vision and giving me the freedom to choose my own path
throughout the time of this research. His constructive critic in the various
meetings we had, coupled with his flexibillity to adapt upon the constant change
in directions in the beginning phase shaped the growth of this research.

A special thanks goes to *Dr. Cristián Maureira-Fredes*. He initially welcomed
me to the Qt Company, supervised me through the internship, and then continued
to provide a constantly supportive environment for me. He's been a patient
audience to a lot of so called "ideas" (read: crazy thoughts) of mine. I
remember that one of the first conversations we had, whilst visiting the Qt
office in Berlin, was about this exact research topic. Something along the
lines of:

> How come, that Qt user interfaces are not available for audio plugins? It
> would be such a good fit.

His response was something like: "Well, perhaps **you** have to implement it.
At the end it's in the open". And here we are. I'm very gratefull
for your trust, the constant help you provided by reviewing my documents or
enlighten me with your knowledge. Your mentoring is exceptional, and I greatly
appreciated and benefitted from that.

Furthermore I want to give a special thanks to *Alexandre Bique*. We initially
met on the SUPERBOOTH23, where I approached him and we quickly got into
discussions about plugins, GUIs and the desiring need to improve that
landscape. He works at Bitwig and he is the inventor of the **C**Lever
**A**udio **P**lugin standard. It is needless to say that without his
initiative and the clear vision he followed, none of this would ever be
possible. He constantly provided me with new ideas, listening to mine and
helping me tremendously to shape the vision for this project. Thanks for helping a
fellow enthusiasts throughout this project.

I also want to thank some outstanding colleques in this regards. First of all
thanks to *Tor Arne Vestbø*. We initially experimented on this topic during a
hackathon at Qt. This was where the foundation of this research emerged and the
core problems where identified. I greatly appreciated your input on this topic.

Furthermore I want to thank *Ivan Solovev*. He helped me to understand some
complex C++ topics and always found the time to listen to my ideas - critically
reviewing them and entering deep and thoughtfull conversations about them.
Those ideas where sometimes very rough and even turned out to be outright
stupid. Nevertheless, you continued to help me. I really appreciated your
critical view and the honest opinion you provided. This is worth a lot.

*Marc Mutz* was similarly indispensable, a presence impossible to ignore. The
*raison d'être* for my rapid progress in exploring and evaluating technologies
was due to his exceptionally deep knowledge in what seemed to me an endless
array of topics. I feel honored that you took the time to listen to the various
topics I casually introduced, and I am deeply impressed by the quality and
depth of the responses I received.

Lastly, I want to thank the QtGrpc team, with *Tatiana Borisova* and *Alexey
Edelev* at the forefront. They are the initiatiors behind QtGrpc and
QtProtobuf. They welcomed me with open arms, guided me throughout the first
contributions and always where supportive with their extensive knowledge in
that field, be it for features to implement, ideas to evaluate, or help required
for this research.
