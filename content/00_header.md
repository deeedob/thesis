abstract: |
  The Qt project is a powerful and versatile C++ framework widely used
  for developing cross-platform applications. Additionally, Qt is no stranger
  to the audio-industry, with a strong presence within professional audio
  companies. If we look into the expanding world of audio-plugins however,
  we would steer into the void when looking for Qt user-interfaces. With this
  work I will explain the reasons and problems that led to this state and show
  a new and innovative approach in solving the problems.
