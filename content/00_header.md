abstract: |
  The Qt project is a robust C++ framework, prominently recognized for enabling
  the development of cross-platform applications. Within the realm of the audio
  industry, Qt maintains a significant presence amongst professional entities.
  However, when examining the domain of audio-plugins, there's a notable
  absence of Qt-based user interfaces. This document elucidates the reasons and
  challenges contributing to this absence. Furthermore, it introduces a
  structured approach to address these challenges. While users often navigate
  the market in search of plugins that cater to their requirements, developers
  face constraints in crafting such plugins. The objective of this research is
  to bridge this disparity, enhancing the resources available to developers,
  especially in the creation of graphical user interfaces for audio plugins.
